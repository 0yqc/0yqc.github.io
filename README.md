# 0yqc.github.io

This is the repository, where my [Github Page (https://0yqc.github.io/)](https://0yqc.github.io/) is hosted from.

The site is designed to mainly work [online](https://0yqc.github.io/) or on a local server (you need to setup it yourself)
If you run this locally you may encounter security problems/errors (eg. Trying to acces other local files) and link problems since on most browsers you need the /index.html at the end.

## Help Me

I'm new to HTML/CSS/JS, so if you notice any errors, or have any suggestions, please contact me.
