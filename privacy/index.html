		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Last Major Edit: April 24, 2025</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			I also care a lot about privacy, hence I don't share my full name on this website and have allias email
			addresses, such as <a href="mailto:0yqc@duck.com">0yqc@duck.com</a>. I think privacy is an important aspect
			of the digital world, therfore, I'm glad you checked out this page.
		</p>
		<h2>What this Site Collects</h2>
		<p class="text_2em">Nothing.</p>
		<p>
			At least automatically. As a static webpage hosted on GitLab, there is no server-side processing or
			collection of any of your data, take a look at the public <a
				href="repo">https://gitlab.com/0yqc/0yqc.gitlab.io/</a> on GitLab if you don't believe my words.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, this website is designed to work offline. Everything needed is in that repository, so no communication
			with 3rd parties.
		</p>
		<h2>Processing/Storing of What You Share</h2>
		<p>
			On the site you may have noticed many kinds of forms. They all work by opening your local email client, with
			predifined fields. The data is not transmitted via the website in any form. However, these emails go to my
			email adress, so I can see all data shared.
		</p>
		<h3>How I Store your information</h3>
		<p>
			I may store any information provided by you via email for any duration until a deletion is requested by you.
			Feature requests and bug reports get stored in my to-do lists, etc.
		</p>
		<h3>How I process your information</h3>
		<p>
			I may process your information in different ways, all locally. Your information will remain private and
			won't be published in any way. However I will be able to see and process it. Processing may include, but is
			not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li>Improving the website for everyone (e.g. Feature Requests)</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Sharing with 3rd Partys</h2>
		<p>
			As of April 24, 2025 no data is beeing shared with 3rd parties. Your data remains local on my device. Emails
			to my email adress go through <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/email/">DuckDuckGo Email Protection</a> and <a
				href="https://gmx.net/">GMX (German Mail Exchange)</a>, a German Email Provider, I do not have any
			control over them, read through they're privacy policies for more details.

		<h2>Objection</h2>

			By submitting any data through any of the forms, which results in an email you send, you agree to me storing

			your consent, please <a href="contact/">Contact Me</a> or directly send an email to <a
